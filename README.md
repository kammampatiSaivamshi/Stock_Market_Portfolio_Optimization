# Stock_Market_Portfolio_Optimization
Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while minimizing the risk, based on historical performance data and financial metrics. If you want to learn how to optimize a stock market portfolio by analyzing the stock market performance, this article is for you. In this project, Iâ€™ll take you through the task of stock market portfolio optimization with Python.

Stock market portfolio optimization involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification. Using techniques such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), we can construct an efficient portfolio that relies on the efficient frontier to represent the optimal trade-off between risk and return.

The expected results from stock market portfolio optimization include identifying the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which indicates the best risk-adjusted return and provides a clear allocation strategy for the selected stocks to achieve long-term investment goals.

To get started with stock market portfolio optimization, we need to collect data about the stock market performance over time. I will collect real-time stock market data using the yfinance API. If you need historical data, you can download it from here.
