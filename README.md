The uploaded project is titled **"Stock Market Portfolio Optimization with Python"**. It focuses on applying financial analysis and optimization techniques to construct an ideal stock portfolio. Here‚Äôs a summary of its objectives and methodology:

### **Project Description**

This project aims to **optimize a stock market portfolio** by selecting the best combination of stocks to **maximize returns** while **minimizing risk**. The approach leverages **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and is implemented in Python.

### **Key Components:**

   * Identify the optimal mix of stocks that offers the best trade-off between risk and return.
   * Maximize the **Sharpe ratio**, which measures risk-adjusted returns.

2. **Data Source**:

   * Uses real-time stock market data collected via the `yfinance` API.
   * Focuses on stocks of **popular Indian companies**.

3. **Methodology**:

   * Analyze historical stock price data.
   * Calculate **expected returns**, **volatility**, and **correlation** among stocks.
   * Construct efficient portfolios using **mean-variance optimization**.
   * Visualize the **efficient frontier** to compare different portfolio choices.

4. **Tools & Libraries**:

   * `pandas` for data manipulation
   * `yfinance` for fetching stock data
   * `datetime` for handling date ranges
   * Additional libraries for warnings suppression and visualization
